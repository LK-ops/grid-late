            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny’s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
            a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!  ”

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.        </div>

You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.  ”
